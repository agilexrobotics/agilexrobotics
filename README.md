Founded in 2016, AgileX Robotics is committed to advancing embodied intelligence innovation and accelerating the global commercialization of robotics through our full-stack robotic technologies and open-source ecosystem.

Rooted in self-developed multi-modal mobile chassis technology, AgileX continuously pushes the boundaries of robots—including robotic arms, data collection devices, and cobots—delivering cutting-edge solutions for academic research and industrial innovation.

To accelerate industry progress, AgileX has launched a data-sharing program that provids global developers with foundational support for AI training and algorithm development. We actively contribute to open-source communities like ROS and Hugging Face, teaming up with experts to turn lab breakthoughts into real-world robotics solutions.
